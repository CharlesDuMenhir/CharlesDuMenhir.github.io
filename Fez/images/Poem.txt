FROM OUT OF NOWHERE 
IMPOSSIBLE VISITORS
OUR BENEFACTORS

WATCHING OVER US
IN THE HIDDEN FOLDS OF SPACE 
IN FRONT OF BEHIND 

GIVE THE GOLDEN GIFT
A DEEP REVELATION 		
OUR EYES WIDE OPEN 

SHAPES TO TESSELLATE 
WITH SACRED GEOMETRY
AN EMPIRE TO BUILD 

A NEW PERSPECTIVE
THINGS UNSEENS BUT ALWAYS THERE
A NEW DIRECTION 

THE HEXAHEDRON 
THE SIXTY FOUR BIT NAME OF GOD
THE POINT OF ORIGIN

A PATTERN A CODE
A DEEP UNDERSTANDING
A GATE TO THE STARS

ALL OF TIME AND SPACE 
AND THE SPACE OUTSIDE OF SPACE 
WHERE DOES IT END
