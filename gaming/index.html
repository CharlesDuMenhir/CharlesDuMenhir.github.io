  <h2>Fez - So mysterious that the mystery is mysterious</h2>
  <h3>The game</h3>

  <p>Fez is 2D game, side view, like the old Mario and Metroid. You play Gomez, a little white creature, living in its 2d-world. In the begining of the game, you meet the Hexaedron. Before exploding, it gives Gomez a Fez, alongwith the ability to grasp the third dimension. From the point of view of the player, the Fez allows to rotate the screen around the environement of Gomez, that doesn't lie anymore in just a vertical plane, but can move according to the four different perspectives. A plateform that was far from Gomez, may be accessible from another dimension. And through the dance of rotations, you can travel through the panels, collecting the 32 cubes, pieces of the broken Hexaedrons. This mechanic, simple while really inventive, is the basis of the gameplay. By the way, the game is really relaxing, with a beautiful pixel art and a very peaceful soundtrack. The panels are wonderful. They involve various environments like a natural region with waterfalls and forests, an industrial district, an ominous cemetery, a scientific complex, and the eternal must-pass sewers.

  <p>But the game soon takes a different turn. First Gomez comes across lots of incomprehensible glyphs. Then some owls deliver him enigmatic messages. Gomez even discover another civilization, the Zu. Their language, the Zuish, seems unreadable. Some chest contains mysterious treasure maps, other contains curious artifacts like the writing and counting cube, but also a indecipherable book, the Tome . Maybe he finds out that some anti-cubes exist. What was a plateform game, turns into a strange and complex puzzle game. Most of the rooms contains a secret, and when all secrets of a room have been solved, it is notified on the map.</p>

<p> At some point, Gomez may have collected 32 cubes allowing him to reach the final steps. He casually opens a stargate. Climbs on top of an alien floating cosmic pyramid. And triggers the end of the game in a psychedelic cinematic. Aaaaaaaand the game restart. Gomez meets again the Hexaedron, and since it probably takes him for a model, he gives Gomez a pair of sunglasses that fits perfectly with his Fez. Actually they are pretty useful. They grant the player the ability to enter first-person view. This will be necessary in the new game +. </p>

  <h3>The first answers</h3>
 <p>In the course of the second travel, we will pass through rooms in which you may distinguishes the subtleties. In the Zu counting classroom, with the counting cube, we learn how works the numeration system of Zu. Each of the six faces we find on the counting cube represents a numbers up to the orientation of the face. By analogy, we understand that each face on the writing cube corresponds to a letter, up to a rotation. Note that two symboles can describe the same number.</p>

<p>In the good room, we may be able to decipher the alphabet. The corresponding room is the one depicted above, with a fox jumping over a dog. Behind them, there is a stele with the characters of the writing cube. On the stele, with the help of the animals on stage, we may understand that it is written, from top to down, then left to right : "The quick brown fox" followed by "jumps over the lazy dog" on the other side of the stele. We recognize the famous english pangram, and get a direct translation between the latin alphabet and the Zuish.</p>

<p>In Nu Zu, an abandoned building full of blinking neons, we find another classroom where we learn how to decypher the glyphs. Those glyphs are actually made of characters, called tetrominos, that correspond to a command for the player. Most of the secrets in the game consist in finding and deciphering them. To understand what to do, we need to follow what is written on the blackboard, in the order given by the number that we understand now. The idea is to decompose the glyph into tetrominos (pieces of four block), turn the glyph anti-clockwise by 90°, and enter the corresponding command. The translation from the tetrominos to the inputs are given in a room containing the stele depicted on top-left of the black board.</p>

<p>The first four inputs are the usual directions. The z and inverse-z correspond to the inputs we enter to rotate the screen, respectively to the left, and the right. The last input is the jump command. </p>
