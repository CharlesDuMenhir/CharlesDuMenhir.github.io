            <h2>Fez - The MetaEnigmatic game</h2>
            <p>
                Fez is a platform game, side-view, similar to classic titles like Mario or Metroid, developped by Polytron and released in 2012. While it starts as a traditional platformer with its own unique mechanics, it gradually transforms into a challenging puzzle game like one that would go on to inspire later titles like Tunic or Animal Well. Nowadays, Fez still remains one the rare games that still holds unsolved mysteries. If you've never played Fez, be aware that spoilers lie ahead. If you know the game, you may be interested in <a href="#UnsolvedSecrets">this section.</a>

                    <h3>The game</h3>
                    <p>
                        You play Gomez, a little white creature, living in VillageVille in its 2D-world. At the beginning of the game, you meet the Hexahedron - a god-like entity that communicates in an unknown language. Before it explodes, it gives Gomez a Fez, along with the ability to perceive the third dimension. Because, in reality, the world of Fez is embedded in 3-dimensional space. From the player's point of view, the Fez allows to rotate the camera around the environment, effectively shifting the 2D plane in which Gomez moves. A platform that seemed unreachable might suddenly become accessible from another angle. This clever rotation mechanic lets you navigate through different levels and regions. Your first objective is to collect golden cubes, which are fragments of the shattered Hexaedron. There are 32 golden cubes in total. You'll need them to open certains doors. This mechanic - simple yet incredibly inventive, form the core of the gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aesthetically, the game is beautiful, in a harmonious pixel art. You start in an astonishing archipelago, go through the most peaceful forest, explore an industrial district as well as an ominous cemetary. Far from your home village, you may reach an old scientific complex, remains of a forgotten civilisation. As a must-pass, you won't avoid a visit to the sewer. These diverse environments are accompanied by an incredible, highly immersive and peaceful soundtrack, composed by <a href="https://disasterpeace.bandcamp.com/album/fez-ost">DisasterPeace</a>.

                        After a few levels, the game takes a different turn. Gomez comes across lots of incomprehensible glyphs. Some owls deliver him enigmatic messages. Gomez discover another civilization, the Zu. They speak the same language as the Hexahedron, the Zuish. Some chests contain mysterious treasure maps, other contain curious artifacts like the writing and counting cubes, but also an indecipherable book, the Tome. Maybe you will find out that some anti-cubes exist. What was a platform game, turns into a strange and complex puzzle game. Most of the rooms contains a secret, and their difficulty continuously increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point, Gomez may have collected 32 cubes allowing him to reach the final steps. He casually opens a stargate. Climbs on top of an alien floating cosmic pyramid. And triggers the end of the game in a psychedelic cinematic. Aaaaaaaand the game restart. Gomez meets again the Hexaedron, and since it probably takes him for a model, he gives Gomez a pair of sunglasses that fits perfectly with his Fez. Actually they are pretty useful. They grant the player the ability to enter first-person view. This will be necessary in new game +.

                    <h3>The first answers</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the course of the second travel, we will pass through rooms in which you may distinguishes the subtleties. In the Zu counting classroom, with the counting cube, we learn how works the numeration system of Zu. Each of the six faces we find on the counting cube represents a numbers up to the orientation of the face. By analogy, we understand that each face on the writing cube corresponds to a letter, up to a rotation. Note that two symboles can describe the same number.

                    <p>
                        In the good room, we may be able to decipher the alphabet. The corresponding room is the one depicted above, with a fox jumping over a dog. Behind them, there is a stele with the characters of the writing cube. On the stele, with the help of the animals on stage, we may understand that it is written, from top to bottom, then left to right : "The quick brown fox" followed by "jumps over the lazy dog" on the other side of the stele. We recognize the famous english pangram, and get a direct translation between the latin alphabet and the Zuish.

                        In Nu Zu, an abandoned building full of blinking neons, we find another classroom where we learn how to decypher the glyphs. Those glyphs are actually made of characters, called tetrominos, that correspond to a input for the player. Most of the secrets in the game consist in finding and deciphering them. To understand what to do, we need to follow what is written on the blackboard, in the order given by the numbers that we understand now. The idea is to decompose the glyph into tetrominos (pieces of four blocks), turn the glyph anti-clockwise by 90°, and enter the corresponding command. The translation from the tetrominos to the inputs are given in a room containing the stele depicted on top-left of the blackboard.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/gaming/images/InputsTranslation.jpg" alt="Fez Input tetromino" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 40%; height: auto;">
                    <p>
                        The first four inputs are the usual directions. The z and inverse-z correspond to the inputs we enter to rotate the screen, respectively to the left, and the right. The last input is the jump command. Usually, the glyphs correspond to a sequence of 8 tetrominos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we have translated the Zuish alphabet, the numbers, and the glyphs. With the help of the sunglasses, we may have found all the remaining cubes, 32 cubes and 32 anti-cubes. Maybe, we have even found the Skull artifact, in a pretty mysterious room. It is worth finishing the game again. Indeed, we get a new ending animation, and a new pair of glasses, the 3D-glasses.

                    <p>
                         When all secrets of a room have been solved, it is notified on the map. Surprisingly, even with the 64 cubes, some rooms indicate that they are not completed. There may be four such rooms: the Security Question Room, the Observatory Interior, The Monolith Room and the Temple of Love. Let's start with the Security Question Room. Basically, it is a single platform with a floating stele. After deciphering the stele, we get the message on the right.

                        A bit tricky but here the solution : What is "what it is", is Meta, by definition. What made it, the game or the question, is Polytron, the compagny. Thus, the solution is Metatron. Actually there was an ingame hint, since the owls mentionned the Metatron at some point. After solving the enigma, we get a Heart Cube. We need to obtain three such cubes to complete the Temple of Love.

                        The next problem is in the scientific complex. When I played the game years ago, I felt very small and powerless in front of the enigma. Even in front of the solution... So, after entered the observatory and approached a big telescope, you can watch to the sky through it. Wait for the night to come because, spoiler, you don't see stars in daylight. Then if you watch in the good direction, you might notice two subtle red dots blinking in the top-left corner. It is pictured in the left picture. You did not see them? Seriously...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What you have to do now? Easy! Write down the sequence of the red dots. And then? Hum... Ok, next step is tricky. In my opinion, if you are not computer-friendly, it is a dead-end. Thankfully, the gaming community is as wide as generous, and you won't wait for a long time before a nice nerd finds the solution. So! Left dot is a 0 and right dot is a 1. Why? Why not! Two stuffs, it is binary! On Switch, the sequence is the following :
                    </p> 
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif;">

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well well well... What now? Maybe you didn't notice the patterns every eight bits. Indeed, the sequences 01010010 and 01001100 are repeated. By converting the sequences from binary to ASCII, you obtain the characters R and L. From the original sequence, it gives : R L L R R L . Then it's up to you to enter these inputs and get your second heart cube. Easy, no? Just you wait!
                    </p>
                </div>

                        It is time to go the Monotlith Room. Apparently it is just a terrace above the door entrance... With your sunglasses on, your observe a glyph on the ground. It looks like the infinite symbol, or an eight, but turned by 45°. It is represented with multiple strips. You have already seen the shape of this glyph on a treasure map. The burnt map. But half of it is still readable. It indicates a position and the tetromino command: <img src="/gaming/images/MonolithCode1.jpg" alt="Fez Monolith code 1" style="width: 100px;">. So Up-R-Up-B-Down-L-Up-Down on Switch. When the command is entered, while Gomez is on the right position, a black floating monolith appears. However, the map still indicates an unsolved secret here. We easily think that we need to enter a second command on the other position, but the map is burnt, and we have no clue on what such a command could be...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maybe a solution can be found in the Tome. Its cover represents a symbol simialr to the symbol on the ground of the Monolith Room. This symbol was used before, to understand the Zuish numeration. It represented the third dimension. At the opening of the book, you may feel an instant regret moment. Tons of Zuish characters... Oh gosh. At the back of each page, there is a big letter. Ok, let's decipher the Tome ! So : F... F... I... L... R... E... W... O... What the duck !!! Guess what ? The characters are not in the usual order. And if that was not enough, neither are the pages ! Long story short, the good page order is : 1-5-2-6-3-7-4-8. The good character order is : page, top-down, rigth-left. In other words, read the first character of the first page, then read the first character of page 5, and continue until all pages have been turned, then you can go back to page 1 character 2 and so on. InsoFox translated it first as he explained on <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/961239-fez/62556785?page=1#11">this topic</a>. Once deciphered, the Tome reveals <a href="/gaming/images/Poem.txt">an enigmatic poem</a>:

            <p>
                Well, thanks for the translation... I don't know if it is more or less clear now... And we won't learn anything new from now. The gaming community don't know any additionnal ingame information. After more than 10 years, nobody has ever figured out how to find the second code of the Monolith Room. To be honest, that is not trully exact. With outgame methods, people managed to solve almost everything. But knowing a solution is different that understanding it. And that the whole problem in Fez. This is both very frustrating and very enjoyable. In my opinion, it is an element that makes a game so memorable. Such games like Celeste or the Souls, embed players in a so deep frustration that any achievment is a liberation. It is not exactly the same in Fez, it is not a Die and Retry, but still there is an analogy. In this last section, I list what might be helpful in the resolution of the Fez last secrets.

                <div class="container-texte">
                    <h4>The second Monolith code</h4>
                    <p>
                        Actually we know the second Monolith code. It has been brute forced by the gaming community, and found by GregStorm. It is "Down Down L R R B Up" on switch. Only seven inputs while all other commands had eight inputs? Okay... The story of the brute forcing is shared through thoses pages (<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/961239-fez/62566926?page=10">discussions</a>, <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/fez/3030-24768/forums/monolith-solution-543751/#6">solution</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/04/why-it-took-almost-a-week-for-the-world-to-completely-finish-fez/">narration</a>).
                        The solution has been found in less than a week after the release of game, however nobody has ever given a coherent explanation on how to find this sequence ingame. And for a lot of people, this is very frustating. The worst is that the community started doubting about the existence of a real solution. We know the sequence, we don't know how to find it, and we don't even know if there is a way to find it. Lots of theories have emerged since. The most famous one is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fez/comments/1hx4ed/spoilers_release_date_theory_possible_monolith/">release date theory</a>. It wore the weakness to be constructed backward from the knowledge of the second code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The politic at Polytron has always been "no comments". However it is not that easy to stay mute. After the brute forcing of the solution: Phil Fish, creator of the game, said : "it was way more interesting and satisfying than what we had originally intended for it". So there might be an intended way! Meanwhile a developper from Polytron said : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fez/comments/21epkk/can_anyone_now_confirm_what_the_lightbar_is_used/">"There's still one thing that nobody never discover"</a>.
                        Finally, 5 years after the release date theory, Renaud Bedard, programmer of Fez, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fez/comments/aggf3z/about_the_release_date_theory_for_the_black/">debunked the theory</a>. What is significant here, is that, after so long, it was important enough for Renaud to bring that information. Yet it is still possible that everything is a troll...

Once reorder such that the poem is readable, it gives P E A B E U A B. We have no clue what it is used for. We don't even know if the big letters are supposed to give the order of the Tome or the inverse. In my opinion, the big letters cannot give the order of the Tome since some letters are redundant. Aso, it is unknown if the Zuish characters appear in the good orientation, maybe it is not at all the good letters. Probably important fact : there are eight letters but only five characters are used.

                    <h5>The concentric circles</h5>
                    <p>
                        In the world of Fez, there are eight white paintings on the ground. They have the shape of concentric circles. Each has a different number of circles, from one to eight. We must use the sunglasses to see them. Except for the fourth one. It is in the fractal room, a room in which you can't turn the screen by yourself, neither use the glasses. The only way to see the painting is to use an outgame method like <a href="noclip.website">noclip</a>. It represents four concentric circles. An important point is that the fractal shape in the room has almost the same shape as the heart cubes. The fact that you can't see the fourth painting could be a link with the fact that there are only seven inputs in the second monolith code. Represented here by the missing cube on the fractal. It is possibe that Gomez need to be at the center of circles and do a specific action. Maybe the levels that contains such square are connected on the map by some peculiar way.

                    <h5>The burnt map</h5>
                    <p>
                        Of course, we used the burnt map to make the monolith appear. But, what is the point to make it appear, while it could have been there already ? Why do we need two codes? This might indicate that the second code could be deduced from the first one.
                    </p> 

                    <h5>The 3D-glasses</h5>
                    <p>
                        When you finish the game with 64 cubes, you are given a pair of 3D-glasses by the Hexaedron. They seem to be useless. In my opinion, they are just here as an easter egg from beyond the forth wall, since 3D-glasses were used to see 3D in cinema theatres, like Gomez getting this ability in the game.

                        The Skull artifact seems to have no use in the game, however it is very enigmatic. Moreover, we can find a poster of the 3-eyed skull in the boiler room in the village of Gomez. In that same room you also find a poster representing a face of the Hexaedron. To me, they are just here as element of the lore. Note that one face of the Hexaedron looks like the book cover.

                    <h5>The Zelda reference</h5>
                    <p>
                        At Gomez's place, there is a poster representing the background of the introduction of the first Legend of Zelda game. It might just be an easter egg, but it can also be a hint. Remember, the command of the monolith code are the four directions and the jump input, so that Gomez doesn't change its position. In Zelda Ocarina of Time, all the famous ocarina songs are played with four directions and an input. There might be a link, or not... Here is <a href="https://ocarina.toomuchofheaven.com/"> a cool application</a> made by vaexenc to play the Ocarina from Zelda.

                    <p>
                        Taking about songs... Even the Ost of Fez holds secret. This is far beyond my comprehension, but people can insert pictures in song files, without altering the song. And they did it in Fez. It provides a gallery of sixteen images, with various references. Because i don't understand everything, I feel quite distant to the idea that it is necessary to find the monolith solution. Though, it is very appreciable to see that they included artists that tried to deform the 3D-reality, like Dali or Escher. Here is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fez/comments/1ijdrds/fez_ost_spectrogram_images_rendered_into_a/">a reddit post</a> and <a href="https://blog.krzyhau.pl/fez-spectrograms-adventure">an explanatory article</a> from the author's blog. Such an amazing work!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand,  when the game has been released on computer, people starts to decompile the game, and explore the files. They find out that, once you got the three Heart Cubes back to the Temple of Love, you can enter a sequence while looking at the writing and counting artifacts in the menu. This makes explode the heart and restart the game. Maybe it corrupts your save... Here is <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/945079-fez/66110193">the original topic</a>.

                        Before me, other people have done such summaries of the Fez mysteries. Below I list some of them, firstly as a credit, because they were helpful for me, secondly for the reader to continue into the rabbit hole. They are pretty interesting and documented. Nowaday, the community is still active and the last release on Switch has renewed the popularity of the game. Still waiting for someone to bring a solution.
