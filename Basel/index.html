      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Zeta(2), The Basel problem</h1>
      <h2>\(~\frac 1 {1^1} + \frac 1 {2^2}+ \frac 1 {3^2}+ \frac 1 {4^2}+~...\) </h2>
      <p>
        That's my favorite math problem. I know. I know... It is an extremly mainstream problem... I know. You can't be original every day!
        Fortunately, not everybody is a mathematician, so maybe I can explain some stuff. The Basel problem boils down to that question : What is the
        value of the sum of the inverse of the square of the natural numbers? It has been solved by Leonhard Euler in
        1735. This is mathematical formulation of the solution:</p>

      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 {n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.
      $$

      <p> Where the not so profane might be surprised to see the number \(\pi\) appear. And for good reason. As far as I
        know, it does not exist an "easy" demonstration. But before delving into the resolutions of the problem, we
        might give some explanations.
      </p>

      <p>First: why does that infinite sum converge? And yes, some infinite sums converge, as long as the terms of the
        sum are small enough. The most obvious example of a convergent sum is given in the paradox of Zenon : Consider
        you go home, but half-way, you stop. Then you go again, and you stop again half-way before home. And so on.
        After an infinite amount of time (it might be long), you arrive home. Well you have an example of a convergent
        infinite series. This one was a geometric series. For geometric series, the convergence is very fast. Actually
        it is exponential! In the case of the Basel problem, the terms do not decrease that quickly. It is the
        particular case of a Riemann sum: </p>
      $$
      \zeta(\alpha) := \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac 1 {n^\alpha}.
      $$
      <p> And it is well known that a Riemann sum converges if and only if \(\alpha > 1\) ( or \( Re(\alpha) > 1\) if we
        extend to complex numbers). For the Basel problem, \(\alpha=2\), so the series converges, and what we compute is
        actually \(\zeta(2)\), the value of the Riemann Zeta function at 2.
      </p>

      <p>Their exist various ways to compute \(\zeta(2)\). In 1999, Robin Chapman from University of Exeter wrote the
        survey <a href="/Basel/files/EvaluatingZeta2ByRobinChapman.pdf">"Evaluating \(\zeta(2)\)"</a> in which he
        provides a collection of such proofs. My favorite one is the sixth. It does not involve advanced theories and
        goes through original, while elementary, formulas like :
      </p>

      $$
      \text{For any } t \in ~] 0; 2\pi [~, \quad
      \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin (nt) < \frac 2 {\sin (\frac t2)}, \quad \text{
        and }
         \quad \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin (nt)}n=\frac{\pi-t}{2}~~. $$
        <p>In the meantime, other proofs have been
        provided. Continuing the work of Robin Chapman, I listed three of them in <a
          href="/Basel/files/ReEvaluatingZeta2ByCharlesDumenil.pdf">that document</a>. They differ from the previous
        one, by bringing geometric and probabilistic aspects.</p>

        <p>As I said, the Basel problem is a part of the Riemann Zeta function. And this function still keeps a lot of
          mysteries. The most obvious one is the Riemann hypothesis itself. But it is far too complicated... The one
          that interests me here is the following : We were able to compute \(\zeta(2)\), actually we have a practical
          expression of \(\zeta(n)\) for any even \(n\). But, for all odd \(n\), we are not even close to a simple
          expression. For instance, all we know about \(\zeta(3)\), the Ap√©ry's constant, is that it is an irrational
          number. I think that's pretty frustrating!</p>

        <p>And yet! We have lots of formulas and hints that may help us. For instance, for any even \(n\), \(\zeta(n)\)
          is a fraction of \(\pi^n\). We may have a pattern here! Also, using proof 6 from the survey of Robin Chapman,
          we can have:
          $$
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos (nt)}{n^2} =\frac{t^2}4-\frac{\pi t}2+\frac{\pi^2}6~~.
          $$

          And up to an integration, we obtain :

          $$
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin (nt)}{n^3} =\frac{t^3}{12}-\frac{\pi t^2}4+\frac{\pi^2t}6~~.
          $$

          At \(t=3\pi/2\), it gives:

          $$
          \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^3}= -\frac{\pi^3}{32}~~.
          $$

          So we can have some results with cubic powers. And we could continue the process to higher degrees. But the
          expression that would interest us is \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos (nt)}{n^3}\), that is \(\zeta (3)\) at
          \(t=0\).
          With the game of alternations between sinus and cosinus through the derivatives, the only way to reach it
          would be to iteratively integrate from \(\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos (nt)}n\). We can give a nice expression
          for \(t \in ]0;2\pi[\):

          $$
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos (nt)}n= -\ln(2\sin (\tfrac t 2))~~.
          $$


          And here comes the problem. We can hardly integrate this expression. So its a dead-end for the method of proof
          6. And I am pretty sure that any other adaptation would be a dead-end too. So the open question is: Why? Is it
          just because of some impossible integrations? Is it for some obscure algebraic reasons? Are all dead-ends
          related in some way? If you have any idea...
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh, while I'm thinking about it: 1+2+3+4+... is never equal to -1/12.
